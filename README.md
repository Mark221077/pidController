# PID controller
This is an Arduino project, to control the temperature of a soldering iron.
The controller is and anti-windup PID controller, optimized for fast heatup.

## Controls
The temperature can be set using a potentiometer, between 200 and 400 degrees Celsius(can be altered in the code). 
The set temperature and the current temperature of the tip is displayed on an OLED display, along with the current control method and the applied voltage.
